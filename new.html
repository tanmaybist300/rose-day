          Greetings on Rose Day, my sweetie! After seeing you from a distance for a while, I've finally worked up the guts to tell you how I really feel. Your grin makes my heart skip a beat, and you are the most gorgeous person I have ever laid eyes on. Like a rose, you are tenacious and powerful at the same time as being delicate and fragrant. I am enthralled by your grace and charisma, and I am moved by your warmth and charity. You are the source of my joy and hope, and the reason I look forward to every day. You are my life's rose, and I wish to always treasure you.
          <br />
